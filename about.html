      The Algae-Matron 1000 was invented by art students Mary Paris, Rosaline Rust, Cindy Tanaka, and Able Lirchner in collaboration with mechanical Engineer Roy Huvver and scientist Kasey Lightyear in 2031, funded by Lenard Dicapriolio’s Cultural Creation Grant. The updated Algae-Matron 3000 was released in 2035, with the opening of its first partner store, Tammy Hildiger. With more and more companies collaborating with us, the first Algae-Matron Center opened in 2040. A year later, the government subsidized the Algae-Matron 3000, allowing for greater accessibility to the people of the United States. Over the next 16 years, almost all apparel production and consumption shifted to fit the Tammy Hildiger model; in addition many independent designers consulted with Algae-Matron. As it’s popularity grew, we realized we needed a more efficient way to make the algae pigment and be more sustainable in the water usage.
      In 2046 we began developing our Water Recycling Center, consulting with the best scientists and engineers to make our vision possible. The next four years were spent perfecting the system until it was launched in 2050. Our first centralized water recycling system was implemented in San Fransisco; while our Algae-Matron Home Water Recycling System, operating with the same process was tested in 100 homes. While the infrastructure in our centralized model is essentially the same, the water treatment facility destination has changed completely. Our home model requires an entirely new septic system. Now we know this isn't easy but it is an investment we trust. For the past ten years we have worked tirelessly to make our water recycling system more accessible, reaching to more than 25 cities and hundreds of thousands of homes, but we promise we are not stopping here. This is the beginning of a new way of life.
